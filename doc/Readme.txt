1. About
    This is a tileset editor for Mystery of the Emblem's menu font.
    
    This was made in about 1 day by modifying my tileset editor for FE5,
    so there are probably some bugs and/or odd behavior.
    
2. Missing Features
    This is a beta release, so several features are missing.
    1. Editing palettes - currently there is no way to edit palettes. 
    2. Loading from ROM - didn't bother to implement it yet.
    
3. Basic Usage
    1. Open the tileset, tiles, and palette files 
        in File -> Open From Files
    2. Make your edits.
    3. Export the files via File -> Export.
    
4. Questions
    1. There are some tiles at the bottom right of the tileset I can't edit!
        This is intentional. The default menu tileset has an uneven number
        of tiles, so I added 5 "fake" tiles to the end to make the display
        cleaner.
